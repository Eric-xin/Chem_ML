## About the QMDB

The Quantum Machine Database (QMDB) is a collection of quantum mechanical data for molecules and materials. The QMDB is a collection of quantum mechanical data for molecules and materials. The `data/datasets/small-data.txt` is a small dataset used for testing the model. The full dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. The full dataset can be downloaded from the [QMDB website](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/).

Codes under this directory are still in the development process, and are not yet ready for use. Currently issue is that the QMDB dataset is too large to load into memory of my personal computer. I am working on a solution to load the dataset in chunks.
