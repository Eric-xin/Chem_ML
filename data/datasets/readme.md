## About datasets used in the `Chem_ML` notebook

The `small_set.txt` is a random selected subset from the QMDB. The dataset is used for testing the model. The full dataset has not yet been used since my personal computer does not have enough memory to load the full dataset. Currently I am working on migrating the code to run on Google Colab to use their GPU and more memory.
